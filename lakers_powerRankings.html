            <p>Lebron is obviously the best player on this team. Even at the age of 35, he still proves that he is also <br> the best player in the world. He should have won mvp this season in my opinion

            <p>This is the first season of Anthony Davis with the Los Angels Lakers and it could not have been better. <br> Davis is top 5 player and one the best big man in the league and if he decides to resign with the Lakers <br> next season, than I will have no doubt that the lakers will repeat.

            <p>His first 2 seasons in Los Angeles were not breathtaking, only averaging 12pts a game on team without <br> a star. But in 2020 post-season, he proved that he is viable option on the offensive end. Making big time <br> trees in the 4th quarter earned himself a well deserved 3rd place.

            <p>Rajon at age 34 still showes us flashes of his Boston days. His basketball-iq is immense, because of this <br> Lebron can take a step back and recover while Rondo runs the offense. And he is also very clutch.

        <p>2-3 years ago, it was thought that Dwight would retire. The best center in the league in 2010, he went to <br> the Lakers to team up with with Kobe in a last assault to get a championschip. But injuries left him straded <br> and he eventually moved on to play with the Rockets with a young James Harden. Also in Houston things <br> wouldn't work out. After years of hopping from team to team he eventually fell back in Los Angeles where <br> he redeemed himself and became a essential roleplayer.
